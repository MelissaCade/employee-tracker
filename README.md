Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

This site allows an employer to enter the names and salaries of all employees, then uses JavaScript to collect the data, publish it to a table on the html page, average the salaries of all employees, and pick a random employee for a drawing. The average salary and random drawing winners are logged in the console.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

A user should first open the inspect console for this page, since some of the functionality is featured there.  
Upon clicking the "Add Employees" button, the user is prompted to enter:  
Employee First Name  
Employee Last Name  
Employee Salary  
Once an employee is fully logged, the user will be asked whether they wish to add another employee.  
If yes, the same "add employee" process is followed again. As many employees as necessary can be added.  
If no, the information gathered from the prompts will populate the Employee Roster Table, and additional information will be available on the console.  
The console will tell the user the average salary of all employees, and pick one employee at random to be the winner of a drawing.
